"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.",4
"Great device, but as One-entry-level plus's offering, there are some minor flaws that will be obvious. The first issue is the perplexing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily phone handling can be aggravating, with fingers locking and unlocking the phone as you try to handle it and place it in your pockets. Although this is not a major issue, it is something to consider. The second point is that there is some lag here and there (only a minor amount), which I am hoping will go away with future updates/improvements.",4
"This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all",4
"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ... Rest UW and Macro i really fell it's useless poor quality pictures by UW camera and Macro shots take lot of time to focus...Airtel 5G is working Jio 5G not tested will update my review after testing...",4
"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4
"It works smoothly, But when your phone gets occupied with some data. It doesn't work the way it used to",4

"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand.

"This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all",4
"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ...

"This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4.

"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4

"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4

"This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all",4
"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4

"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4

"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed.

The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.

"This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all",4
"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4

"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4

"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand.

"This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all",4
"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days.

"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4

"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed.

Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets.

The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.

"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4

"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand.

There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ... Rest UW and Macro i really fell it's useless poor quality pictures by UW camera and Macro shots take lot of time to focus...Airtel 5G is working Jio 5G not tested will update my review after testing...",4
"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4
"It works smoothly, But when your phone gets occupied with some data. It doesn't work the way it used to",4
"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.",4
"Great device, but as One-entry-level plus's offering, there are some minor flaws that will be obvious. The first issue is the perplexing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily phone handling can be aggravating, with fingers locking and unlocking the phone as you try to handle it and place it in your pockets. Although this is not a major issue, it is something to consider. The second point is that there is some lag here and there (only a minor amount), which I am hoping will go away with future updates/improvements.",4

This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ... Rest UW and Macro i really fell it's useless poor quality pictures by UW camera and Macro shots take lot of time to focus...Airtel 5G is working Jio 5G not tested will update my review after testing...",4
"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4
"It works smoothly, But when your phone gets occupied with some data. It doesn't work the way it used to",4
"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.",4
"Great device, but as One-entry-level plus's offering, there are some minor flaws that will be obvious. The first issue is the perplexing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily phone handling can be aggravating, with fingers locking and unlocking the phone as you try to handle it and place it in your pockets. Although this is not a major issue, it is something to consider. The second point is that there is some lag here and there (only a minor amount), which I am hoping will go away with future updates/improvements.",4

"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ... Rest UW and Macro i really fell it's useless poor quality pictures by UW camera and Macro shots take lot of time to focus...Airtel 5G is working Jio 5G not tested will update my review after testing...",4
"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4
"It works smoothly, But when your phone gets occupied with some data. It doesn't work the way it used to",4
"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.",4
"Great device, but as One-entry-level plus's offering, there are some minor flaws that will be obvious. The first issue is the perplexing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily phone handling can be aggravating, with fingers locking and unlocking the phone as you try to handle it and place it in your pockets. Although this is not a major issue, it is something to consider. The second point is that there is some lag here and there (only a minor amount), which I am hoping will go away with future updates/improvements.",4

"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ... Rest UW and Macro i really fell it's useless poor quality pictures by UW camera and Macro shots take lot of time to focus...Airtel 5G is working Jio 5G not tested will update my review after testing...",4
"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4
"It works smoothly, But when your phone gets occupied with some data. It doesn't work the way it used to",4
"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.",4
"Great device, but as One-entry-level plus's offering, there are some minor flaws that will be obvious. The first issue is the perplexing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily phone handling can be aggravating, with fingers locking and unlocking the phone as you try to handle it and place it in your pockets. Although this is not a major issue, it is something to consider. The second point is that there is some lag here and there (only a minor amount), which I am hoping will go away with future updates/improvements.",4

"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ... Rest UW and Macro i really fell it's useless poor quality pictures by UW camera and Macro shots take lot of time to focus...Airtel 5G is working Jio 5G not tested will update my review after testing...",4
"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4
"It works smoothly, But when your phone gets occupied with some data. It doesn't work the way it used to",4
"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.",4
"Great device, but as One-entry-level plus's offering, there are some minor flaws that will be obvious. The first issue is the perplexing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily phone handling can be aggravating, with fingers locking and unlocking the phone as you try to handle it and place it in your pockets.

"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ... Rest UW and Macro i really fell it's useless poor quality pictures by UW camera and Macro shots take lot of time to focus...Airtel 5G is working Jio 5G not tested will update my review after testing...",4
"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4
"It works smoothly, But when your phone gets occupied with some data. It doesn't work the way it used to",4
"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.",4
"Great device, but as One-entry-level plus's offering, there are some minor flaws that will be obvious. The first issue is the perplexing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily phone handling can be aggravating, with fingers locking and unlocking the phone as you try to handle it and place it in your pockets.

"This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4.

"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ... Rest UW and Macro i really fell it's useless poor quality pictures by UW camera and Macro shots take lot of time to focus...Airtel 5G is working Jio 5G not tested will update my review after testing...",4
"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4
"It works smoothly, But when your phone gets occupied with some data. It doesn't work the way it used to",4
"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.",4

"This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all",4
"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ... Rest UW and Macro i really fell it's useless poor quality pictures by UW camera and Macro shots take lot of time to focus...Airtel 5G is working Jio 5G not tested will update my review after testing...",4
"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4
"It works smoothly, But when your phone gets occupied with some data. It doesn't work the way it used to",4
"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.",4

"This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all",4
"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ... Rest UW and Macro i really fell it's useless poor quality pictures by UW camera and Macro shots take lot of time to focus...Airtel 5G is working Jio 5G not tested will update my review after testing...",4
"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4
"It works smoothly, But when your phone gets occupied with some data. It doesn't work the way it used to",4
"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered.

"This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all",4
"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ... Rest UW and Macro i really fell it's useless poor quality pictures by UW camera and Macro shots take lot of time to focus...Airtel 5G is working Jio 5G not tested will update my review after testing...",4
"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4

"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered.

"This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all",4
"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ... Rest UW and Macro i really fell it's useless poor quality pictures by UW camera and Macro shots take lot of time to focus...Airtel 5G is working Jio 5G not tested will update my review after testing...",4
"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4

"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed.

Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.

"This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all",4
"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ...

"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4

"Great device, but as One-entry-level plus's offering, there are some minor flaws that will be obvious. The first issue is the perplexing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor).

"This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all",4
"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ...

"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4

"This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all",4
"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ... Rest UW and Macro i really fell it's useless poor quality pictures by UW camera and Macro shots take lot of time to focus...Airtel 5G is working Jio 5G not tested will update my review after testing...",4
"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4

The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.

"Great device, but as One-entry-level plus's offering, there are some minor flaws that will be obvious. The first issue is the perplexing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor).

"This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all",4
"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ...

"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4

Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.",4
"Great device, but as One-entry-level plus's offering, there are some minor flaws that will be obvious. The first issue is the perplexing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor).

Although this is not a major issue, it is something to consider.

"This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all",4
"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ... Rest UW and Macro i really fell it's useless poor quality pictures by UW camera and Macro shots take lot of time to focus...Airtel 5G is working Jio 5G not tested will update my review after testing...",4
"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4

"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand.

"This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all",4
"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ...

"This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4.

"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4

"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4

"This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all",4
"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4

"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4

"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed.

The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.

"This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all",4
"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4

"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4

"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand.

"This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all",4
"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days.

"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4

"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed.

Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets.

The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.

"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4

"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand.

There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ... Rest UW and Macro i really fell it's useless poor quality pictures by UW camera and Macro shots take lot of time to focus...Airtel 5G is working Jio 5G not tested will update my review after testing...",4
"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4
"It works smoothly, But when your phone gets occupied with some data. It doesn't work the way it used to",4
"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.",4
"Great device, but as One-entry-level plus's offering, there are some minor flaws that will be obvious. The first issue is the perplexing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily phone handling can be aggravating, with fingers locking and unlocking the phone as you try to handle it and place it in your pockets. Although this is not a major issue, it is something to consider. The second point is that there is some lag here and there (only a minor amount), which I am hoping will go away with future updates/improvements.",4

This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ... Rest UW and Macro i really fell it's useless poor quality pictures by UW camera and Macro shots take lot of time to focus...Airtel 5G is working Jio 5G not tested will update my review after testing...",4
"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4
"It works smoothly, But when your phone gets occupied with some data. It doesn't work the way it used to",4
"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.",4
"Great device, but as One-entry-level plus's offering, there are some minor flaws that will be obvious. The first issue is the perplexing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily phone handling can be aggravating, with fingers locking and unlocking the phone as you try to handle it and place it in your pockets. Although this is not a major issue, it is something to consider. The second point is that there is some lag here and there (only a minor amount), which I am hoping will go away with future updates/improvements.",4

"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ... Rest UW and Macro i really fell it's useless poor quality pictures by UW camera and Macro shots take lot of time to focus...Airtel 5G is working Jio 5G not tested will update my review after testing...",4
"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4
"It works smoothly, But when your phone gets occupied with some data. It doesn't work the way it used to",4
"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.",4
"Great device, but as One-entry-level plus's offering, there are some minor flaws that will be obvious. The first issue is the perplexing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily phone handling can be aggravating, with fingers locking and unlocking the phone as you try to handle it and place it in your pockets. Although this is not a major issue, it is something to consider. The second point is that there is some lag here and there (only a minor amount), which I am hoping will go away with future updates/improvements.",4

"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ... Rest UW and Macro i really fell it's useless poor quality pictures by UW camera and Macro shots take lot of time to focus...Airtel 5G is working Jio 5G not tested will update my review after testing...",4
"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4
"It works smoothly, But when your phone gets occupied with some data. It doesn't work the way it used to",4
"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.",4
"Great device, but as One-entry-level plus's offering, there are some minor flaws that will be obvious. The first issue is the perplexing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily phone handling can be aggravating, with fingers locking and unlocking the phone as you try to handle it and place it in your pockets. Although this is not a major issue, it is something to consider. The second point is that there is some lag here and there (only a minor amount), which I am hoping will go away with future updates/improvements.",4

"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ... Rest UW and Macro i really fell it's useless poor quality pictures by UW camera and Macro shots take lot of time to focus...Airtel 5G is working Jio 5G not tested will update my review after testing...",4
"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4
"It works smoothly, But when your phone gets occupied with some data. It doesn't work the way it used to",4
"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.",4
"Great device, but as One-entry-level plus's offering, there are some minor flaws that will be obvious. The first issue is the perplexing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily phone handling can be aggravating, with fingers locking and unlocking the phone as you try to handle it and place it in your pockets.

"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ... Rest UW and Macro i really fell it's useless poor quality pictures by UW camera and Macro shots take lot of time to focus...Airtel 5G is working Jio 5G not tested will update my review after testing...",4
"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4
"It works smoothly, But when your phone gets occupied with some data. It doesn't work the way it used to",4
"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.",4
"Great device, but as One-entry-level plus's offering, there are some minor flaws that will be obvious. The first issue is the perplexing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily phone handling can be aggravating, with fingers locking and unlocking the phone as you try to handle it and place it in your pockets.

"This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4.

"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ... Rest UW and Macro i really fell it's useless poor quality pictures by UW camera and Macro shots take lot of time to focus...Airtel 5G is working Jio 5G not tested will update my review after testing...",4
"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4
"It works smoothly, But when your phone gets occupied with some data. It doesn't work the way it used to",4
"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.",4

"This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all",4
"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ... Rest UW and Macro i really fell it's useless poor quality pictures by UW camera and Macro shots take lot of time to focus...Airtel 5G is working Jio 5G not tested will update my review after testing...",4
"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4
"It works smoothly, But when your phone gets occupied with some data. It doesn't work the way it used to",4
"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.",4

"This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all",4
"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ... Rest UW and Macro i really fell it's useless poor quality pictures by UW camera and Macro shots take lot of time to focus...Airtel 5G is working Jio 5G not tested will update my review after testing...",4
"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4
"It works smoothly, But when your phone gets occupied with some data. It doesn't work the way it used to",4
"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered.

"This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all",4
"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ... Rest UW and Macro i really fell it's useless poor quality pictures by UW camera and Macro shots take lot of time to focus...Airtel 5G is working Jio 5G not tested will update my review after testing...",4
"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4

"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered.

"This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all",4
"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ... Rest UW and Macro i really fell it's useless poor quality pictures by UW camera and Macro shots take lot of time to focus...Airtel 5G is working Jio 5G not tested will update my review after testing...",4
"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4

"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed.

Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.

"This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all",4
"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ...

"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4

"Great device, but as One-entry-level plus's offering, there are some minor flaws that will be obvious. The first issue is the perplexing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor).

"This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all",4
"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ...

"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4

"This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all",4
"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ... Rest UW and Macro i really fell it's useless poor quality pictures by UW camera and Macro shots take lot of time to focus...Airtel 5G is working Jio 5G not tested will update my review after testing...",4
"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4

The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.

"Great device, but as One-entry-level plus's offering, there are some minor flaws that will be obvious. The first issue is the perplexing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor).

"This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all",4
"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ...

"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4

Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.",4
"Great device, but as One-entry-level plus's offering, there are some minor flaws that will be obvious. The first issue is the perplexing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor).

Although this is not a major issue, it is something to consider.

"This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all",4
"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ... Rest UW and Macro i really fell it's useless poor quality pictures by UW camera and Macro shots take lot of time to focus...Airtel 5G is working Jio 5G not tested will update my review after testing...",4
"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4

"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand.

"This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all",4
"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ...

"This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4.

"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4

"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4

"This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all",4
"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4

"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4

"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed.

The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.

"This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all",4
"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4

"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4

"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand.

"This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all",4
"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days.

"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4

"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed.

Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets.

The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.

"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4

"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand.

There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ... Rest UW and Macro i really fell it's useless poor quality pictures by UW camera and Macro shots take lot of time to focus...Airtel 5G is working Jio 5G not tested will update my review after testing...",4
"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4
"It works smoothly, But when your phone gets occupied with some data. It doesn't work the way it used to",4
"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.",4
"Great device, but as One-entry-level plus's offering, there are some minor flaws that will be obvious. The first issue is the perplexing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily phone handling can be aggravating, with fingers locking and unlocking the phone as you try to handle it and place it in your pockets. Although this is not a major issue, it is something to consider. The second point is that there is some lag here and there (only a minor amount), which I am hoping will go away with future updates/improvements.",4

This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ... Rest UW and Macro i really fell it's useless poor quality pictures by UW camera and Macro shots take lot of time to focus...Airtel 5G is working Jio 5G not tested will update my review after testing...",4
"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4
"It works smoothly, But when your phone gets occupied with some data. It doesn't work the way it used to",4
"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.",4
"Great device, but as One-entry-level plus's offering, there are some minor flaws that will be obvious. The first issue is the perplexing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily phone handling can be aggravating, with fingers locking and unlocking the phone as you try to handle it and place it in your pockets. Although this is not a major issue, it is something to consider. The second point is that there is some lag here and there (only a minor amount), which I am hoping will go away with future updates/improvements.",4

"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ... Rest UW and Macro i really fell it's useless poor quality pictures by UW camera and Macro shots take lot of time to focus...Airtel 5G is working Jio 5G not tested will update my review after testing...",4
"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4
"It works smoothly, But when your phone gets occupied with some data. It doesn't work the way it used to",4
"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.",4
"Great device, but as One-entry-level plus's offering, there are some minor flaws that will be obvious. The first issue is the perplexing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily phone handling can be aggravating, with fingers locking and unlocking the phone as you try to handle it and place it in your pockets. Although this is not a major issue, it is something to consider. The second point is that there is some lag here and there (only a minor amount), which I am hoping will go away with future updates/improvements.",4

"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ... Rest UW and Macro i really fell it's useless poor quality pictures by UW camera and Macro shots take lot of time to focus...Airtel 5G is working Jio 5G not tested will update my review after testing...",4
"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4
"It works smoothly, But when your phone gets occupied with some data. It doesn't work the way it used to",4
"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.",4
"Great device, but as One-entry-level plus's offering, there are some minor flaws that will be obvious. The first issue is the perplexing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily phone handling can be aggravating, with fingers locking and unlocking the phone as you try to handle it and place it in your pockets. Although this is not a major issue, it is something to consider. The second point is that there is some lag here and there (only a minor amount), which I am hoping will go away with future updates/improvements.",4

"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ... Rest UW and Macro i really fell it's useless poor quality pictures by UW camera and Macro shots take lot of time to focus...Airtel 5G is working Jio 5G not tested will update my review after testing...",4
"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4
"It works smoothly, But when your phone gets occupied with some data. It doesn't work the way it used to",4
"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.",4
"Great device, but as One-entry-level plus's offering, there are some minor flaws that will be obvious. The first issue is the perplexing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily phone handling can be aggravating, with fingers locking and unlocking the phone as you try to handle it and place it in your pockets.

"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ... Rest UW and Macro i really fell it's useless poor quality pictures by UW camera and Macro shots take lot of time to focus...Airtel 5G is working Jio 5G not tested will update my review after testing...",4
"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4
"It works smoothly, But when your phone gets occupied with some data. It doesn't work the way it used to",4
"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.",4
"Great device, but as One-entry-level plus's offering, there are some minor flaws that will be obvious. The first issue is the perplexing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily phone handling can be aggravating, with fingers locking and unlocking the phone as you try to handle it and place it in your pockets.

"This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4.

"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ... Rest UW and Macro i really fell it's useless poor quality pictures by UW camera and Macro shots take lot of time to focus...Airtel 5G is working Jio 5G not tested will update my review after testing...",4
"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4
"It works smoothly, But when your phone gets occupied with some data. It doesn't work the way it used to",4
"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.",4

"This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all",4
"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ... Rest UW and Macro i really fell it's useless poor quality pictures by UW camera and Macro shots take lot of time to focus...Airtel 5G is working Jio 5G not tested will update my review after testing...",4
"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4
"It works smoothly, But when your phone gets occupied with some data. It doesn't work the way it used to",4
"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.",4

"This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all",4
"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ... Rest UW and Macro i really fell it's useless poor quality pictures by UW camera and Macro shots take lot of time to focus...Airtel 5G is working Jio 5G not tested will update my review after testing...",4
"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4
"It works smoothly, But when your phone gets occupied with some data. It doesn't work the way it used to",4
"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered.

"This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all",4
"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ... Rest UW and Macro i really fell it's useless poor quality pictures by UW camera and Macro shots take lot of time to focus...Airtel 5G is working Jio 5G not tested will update my review after testing...",4
"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4

"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered.

"This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all",4
"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ... Rest UW and Macro i really fell it's useless poor quality pictures by UW camera and Macro shots take lot of time to focus...Airtel 5G is working Jio 5G not tested will update my review after testing...",4
"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4

"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed.

Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.

"This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all",4
"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ...

"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4

"Great device, but as One-entry-level plus's offering, there are some minor flaws that will be obvious. The first issue is the perplexing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor).

"This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all",4
"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ...

"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4

"This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all",4
"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ... Rest UW and Macro i really fell it's useless poor quality pictures by UW camera and Macro shots take lot of time to focus...Airtel 5G is working Jio 5G not tested will update my review after testing...",4
"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4

The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.

"Great device, but as One-entry-level plus's offering, there are some minor flaws that will be obvious. The first issue is the perplexing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor).

"This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all",4
"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ...

"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4

Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.",4
"Great device, but as One-entry-level plus's offering, there are some minor flaws that will be obvious. The first issue is the perplexing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor).

Although this is not a major issue, it is something to consider.

"This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all",4
"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ... Rest UW and Macro i really fell it's useless poor quality pictures by UW camera and Macro shots take lot of time to focus...Airtel 5G is working Jio 5G not tested will update my review after testing...",4
"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4

"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand.

"This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all",4
"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ...

"This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4.

"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4

"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4

"This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all",4
"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4

"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4

"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed.

The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.

"This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all",4
"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4

"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4

"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand.

"This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all",4
"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days.

"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4

"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed.

Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets.

The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.

"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4

"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand.

There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ... Rest UW and Macro i really fell it's useless poor quality pictures by UW camera and Macro shots take lot of time to focus...Airtel 5G is working Jio 5G not tested will update my review after testing...",4
"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4
"It works smoothly, But when your phone gets occupied with some data. It doesn't work the way it used to",4
"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.",4
"Great device, but as One-entry-level plus's offering, there are some minor flaws that will be obvious. The first issue is the perplexing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily phone handling can be aggravating, with fingers locking and unlocking the phone as you try to handle it and place it in your pockets. Although this is not a major issue, it is something to consider. The second point is that there is some lag here and there (only a minor amount), which I am hoping will go away with future updates/improvements.",4

This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ... Rest UW and Macro i really fell it's useless poor quality pictures by UW camera and Macro shots take lot of time to focus...Airtel 5G is working Jio 5G not tested will update my review after testing...",4
"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4
"It works smoothly, But when your phone gets occupied with some data. It doesn't work the way it used to",4
"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.",4
"Great device, but as One-entry-level plus's offering, there are some minor flaws that will be obvious. The first issue is the perplexing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily phone handling can be aggravating, with fingers locking and unlocking the phone as you try to handle it and place it in your pockets. Although this is not a major issue, it is something to consider. The second point is that there is some lag here and there (only a minor amount), which I am hoping will go away with future updates/improvements.",4

"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ... Rest UW and Macro i really fell it's useless poor quality pictures by UW camera and Macro shots take lot of time to focus...Airtel 5G is working Jio 5G not tested will update my review after testing...",4
"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4
"It works smoothly, But when your phone gets occupied with some data. It doesn't work the way it used to",4
"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.",4
"Great device, but as One-entry-level plus's offering, there are some minor flaws that will be obvious. The first issue is the perplexing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily phone handling can be aggravating, with fingers locking and unlocking the phone as you try to handle it and place it in your pockets. Although this is not a major issue, it is something to consider. The second point is that there is some lag here and there (only a minor amount), which I am hoping will go away with future updates/improvements.",4

"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ... Rest UW and Macro i really fell it's useless poor quality pictures by UW camera and Macro shots take lot of time to focus...Airtel 5G is working Jio 5G not tested will update my review after testing...",4
"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4
"It works smoothly, But when your phone gets occupied with some data. It doesn't work the way it used to",4
"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.",4
"Great device, but as One-entry-level plus's offering, there are some minor flaws that will be obvious. The first issue is the perplexing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily phone handling can be aggravating, with fingers locking and unlocking the phone as you try to handle it and place it in your pockets. Although this is not a major issue, it is something to consider. The second point is that there is some lag here and there (only a minor amount), which I am hoping will go away with future updates/improvements.",4

"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ... Rest UW and Macro i really fell it's useless poor quality pictures by UW camera and Macro shots take lot of time to focus...Airtel 5G is working Jio 5G not tested will update my review after testing...",4
"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4
"It works smoothly, But when your phone gets occupied with some data. It doesn't work the way it used to",4
"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.",4
"Great device, but as One-entry-level plus's offering, there are some minor flaws that will be obvious. The first issue is the perplexing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily phone handling can be aggravating, with fingers locking and unlocking the phone as you try to handle it and place it in your pockets.

"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ... Rest UW and Macro i really fell it's useless poor quality pictures by UW camera and Macro shots take lot of time to focus...Airtel 5G is working Jio 5G not tested will update my review after testing...",4
"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4
"It works smoothly, But when your phone gets occupied with some data. It doesn't work the way it used to",4
"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.",4
"Great device, but as One-entry-level plus's offering, there are some minor flaws that will be obvious. The first issue is the perplexing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily phone handling can be aggravating, with fingers locking and unlocking the phone as you try to handle it and place it in your pockets.

"This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4.

"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ... Rest UW and Macro i really fell it's useless poor quality pictures by UW camera and Macro shots take lot of time to focus...Airtel 5G is working Jio 5G not tested will update my review after testing...",4
"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4
"It works smoothly, But when your phone gets occupied with some data. It doesn't work the way it used to",4
"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.",4

"This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all",4
"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ... Rest UW and Macro i really fell it's useless poor quality pictures by UW camera and Macro shots take lot of time to focus...Airtel 5G is working Jio 5G not tested will update my review after testing...",4
"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4
"It works smoothly, But when your phone gets occupied with some data. It doesn't work the way it used to",4
"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.",4

"This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all",4
"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ... Rest UW and Macro i really fell it's useless poor quality pictures by UW camera and Macro shots take lot of time to focus...Airtel 5G is working Jio 5G not tested will update my review after testing...",4
"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4
"It works smoothly, But when your phone gets occupied with some data. It doesn't work the way it used to",4
"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered.

"This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all",4
"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ... Rest UW and Macro i really fell it's useless poor quality pictures by UW camera and Macro shots take lot of time to focus...Airtel 5G is working Jio 5G not tested will update my review after testing...",4
"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4

"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered.

"This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all",4
"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ... Rest UW and Macro i really fell it's useless poor quality pictures by UW camera and Macro shots take lot of time to focus...Airtel 5G is working Jio 5G not tested will update my review after testing...",4
"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4

"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed.

Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.

"This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all",4
"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ...

"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4

"Great device, but as One-entry-level plus's offering, there are some minor flaws that will be obvious. The first issue is the perplexing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor).

"This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all",4
"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ...

"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4

"This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all",4
"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ... Rest UW and Macro i really fell it's useless poor quality pictures by UW camera and Macro shots take lot of time to focus...Airtel 5G is working Jio 5G not tested will update my review after testing...",4
"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4

The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.

"Great device, but as One-entry-level plus's offering, there are some minor flaws that will be obvious. The first issue is the perplexing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor).

"This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all",4
"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ...

"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4

Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.",4
"Great device, but as One-entry-level plus's offering, there are some minor flaws that will be obvious. The first issue is the perplexing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor).

Although this is not a major issue, it is something to consider.

"This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all",4
"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ... Rest UW and Macro i really fell it's useless poor quality pictures by UW camera and Macro shots take lot of time to focus...Airtel 5G is working Jio 5G not tested will update my review after testing...",4
"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4

"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand.

"This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all",4
"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ...

"This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4.

"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4

"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4

"This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all",4
"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4

"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4

"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed.

The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.

"This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all",4
"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4

"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4

"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand.

"This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all",4
"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days.

"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4

"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed.

Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets.

The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.

"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4

"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand.

There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4
"Performance is good no lag in day to day usesI will basically talk about camera ü§≥Primary 64mp Camera is good I say in proper lighting conditions, Portrait shots are nice, Video quality is not good my old K20 pro takes far better video than this ... Rest UW and Macro i really fell it's useless poor quality pictures by UW camera and Macro shots take lot of time to focus...Airtel 5G is working Jio 5G not tested will update my review after testing...",4
"Good one for the price. Using it for 2 days now. Battery life is more than I expected. Without much usage lasting for almost two days. Good display and smooth functionality. Some times, it flickers in some apps like messages. Don't know why.",4
"I am facing problem in this phone. That is, whenever I am calling someone on a normal phone, then the problem of call dropping is coming. And sometimes when you call someone, the voice sound is not coming.And the camera quality is not good.",4
"Whenever someone calls, this device takes sometime to show who is calling. This is only the thing I don't like about it rest everything is good though.",4
Using for the last three months. So far so good.Actually you can't expect more than this one at this price point.Strongly recommend.,4
"It works smoothly, But when your phone gets occupied with some data. It doesn't work the way it used to",4
"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.",4
"Great device, but as One-entry-level plus's offering, there are some minor flaws that will be obvious. The first issue is the perplexing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily phone handling can be aggravating, with fingers locking and unlocking the phone as you try to handle it and place it in your pockets. Although this is not a major issue, it is something to consider. The second point is that there is some lag here and there (only a minor amount), which I am hoping will go away with future updates/improvements.",4
"This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all",4
